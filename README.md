This project was created so that all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. It was my first time using grid layout for styling. I look forward to using it more in the future and familiarizing my self deeper with its uses/fuctions. So far this has been the most difficult project to complete, but working with grid, font faces, and media queries will only exponentially get easier with every use moving forward.
